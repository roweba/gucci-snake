Feb. 12th 2018 - Notes from Battlesnake Team meeting

TODO LIST:
1) Heroku server
2) Be able to actually get into a game
3) Circle back onto ourselves
4) Dash out for food
5) Translate the json, ie. "set-up the board" based on the board rules described below 

docs to references:
	- the best info https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-server
	- our repo https://github.com/ssojj/battlesnake2k18
	- example snake https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-python

 - choose and implement a pathfinding algorithm
	- some snakes used floodfill (?)
	- Dijkstra's vs A* (we have code for A* - Nikita)
		- both find shortest paths
		- A* is used for video game enemy pathfinding
		- (+) we must determine which is better
		- from Computerfile video:
			- Dijkstra's can take longer, because it checks every node, uses BFS
			- A* checks fewer nodes as it goes along so can sometimes be faster than Dijkstra's

 - choose an algorithm to determine "safety"
	- walls = not safe
	- snake body = NOT SAFE
	- other snake's tail = safe
	- blocks around another snake's head = <depends>
		- safe when:
		- NOT SAFE when:
	- create a 2D array that describes the "safeness" for every square
		- important: decide the schema
			- unsafe spaces are negative
			- safe spaces are positives
			- decisions consider game state at next turn
			- the number code
				- MY_HEAD 0: our own head
				- MY_TAIL 2: our own tail 
				- EMPTY 1: empty tile (includes other snake tail)
				- FOOD 8: food
				- SNAKE_BODY -1: snake body (includes our own body and other snakes head)
				- HALO -2: tiles next to other snake heads (this may change), named because a halo is in close proximity to the head of an angel, just as the tiles marked HALO are adjacent to a tile marked SNAKE_BODY
				- BLOCKED -3: a tile that cannot be reached ie. the pathfinding algorithm returned false when given this tile 
	- should tiles be marked unreachable? yes!
		- if pathfinding algo returns false, we must mark that destination as BLOCKED

Name of server: theguardianofforever
Name of snake: Gucci Snake

High level overview of our snake's server's decisions:
(1) Our server receives POST request from game server
(2) Examine game board
(3) Choose Strategy
(4) Implement Strategy
(5) Return move


List of Strategies:
(1) Dash for food
(2) Stay in corner
(3) Cut people off

Meagan's notes from discussion:
- how to use git
	- git status
	- git add todo.txt
	- git commit -m "This message explains my most recent change."
	- git push
	- git has version control, so if we mess up, we can roll back
- a plan for success, based on experience from last year
	- get good at python
	- make a chicken snake, lives in corner, only comes out to get food
		- this has benefits, is a small snake, mitigates collision
	- keeping snake small
		- good: not too long, easier to manage, less collision, needs less food
		- bad: relies on other snakes to die, could get trapped or killed by large snakes
		- aim for kills? nope, but implement a "cutting off" Strategy
	- best way to idle? ie. when our snake isn't going for food
		- circles
		- looping strategy, smallest path to tail
		- if our snake is big, we could implement a Strategy where we cut off half the board to our opponents
	- an important element: to have the snake be big or small
		- when there are lots of snakes, <i missed this part>
		- recalled that succesful snakes where generally small/medium sized
		- trying to get lots of food and be longer has a higher overhead than staying small/medium sized
		- but a bigger snake has more control over the board
		- it's a tradeoff and our snake will implement both
	- a snake near the edge of the board is less vulnerable to colliding with other snakes, but has one less direction to move in, should it get cornered
		- a passive loop could mitigate risk of running into it's own body
	- examining Better Than Aleksiy's snake
		- multithreading?? you better believe it! 
		- does Heroku have multicores?
	- we are using python 2.7
	- don't forget that the top left of the game board is (0,0)
	- plan to make a 2D array to keep track of board data based on "safety" relative to our snake
