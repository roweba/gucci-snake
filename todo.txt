Feb. 12th 2018 - Notes from Battlesnake Team meeting




 - choose and implement a pathfinding algorithm
	- Dijkstra's vs A*
		- both find shortest paths
		- A* is used for video game enemy pathfinding
		- (+) we must determine which is better
		- from Computerfile video:
			- Dijkstra's can take longer, because it checks every node, uses BFS
			- A* checks fewer nodes as it goes along so can sometimes be faster than Dijkstra's

 - choose 	an algorithm to determine "safety"
	- walls = not safe
	- snake body = NOT SAFE
	- other snake's tail = safe
	- blocks around another snake's head = <depends>
		- safe when:
		- NOT SAFE when:
