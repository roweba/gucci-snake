Feb. 12th 2018 - Notes from Battlesnake Team meeting

TODO LIST:
1) Heroku server
2) Be able to actually get into a game
3) Circle back onto ourselves
4) Dash out for food


 - choose and implement a pathfinding algorithm
	- Dijkstra's vs A*
		- both find shortest paths
		- A* is used for video game enemy pathfinding
		- (+) we must determine which is better
		- from Computerfile video:
			- Dijkstra's can take longer, because it checks every node, uses BFS
			- A* checks fewer nodes as it goes along so can sometimes be faster than Dijkstra's

 - choose 	an algorithm to determine "safety"
	- walls = not safe
	- snake body = NOT SAFE
	- other snake's tail = safe
	- blocks around another snake's head = <depends>
		- safe when:
		- NOT SAFE when:

Name of server: theguardianofforever
Name of snake: Gucci Snake

High level overview of our snake's server's decisions:
(1) Our server receives POST request from game server
(2) Examine game board
(3) Choose Strategy
(4) Implement Strategy
(5) Return move


List of Strategies:
(1) Dash for food
(2) Stay in corner
(3) Cut people off
